# DBD Data

A lil data science project. DBD (Dead by Daylight) is a game I .. sometimes .. enjoy and the subreddit for it generally gets into heated debates around things such as "the game is killer sided" or "survivor sided". There's also the debate of whether the sub itself is sided or not. For this project I decided to look at the data and see if I can deduce if / which side the sub generally favors.
